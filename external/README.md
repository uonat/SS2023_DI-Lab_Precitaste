## Grounding DINO: Open Vocabulary Object Detection ##

Grounding DINO (Detection In Natural Language with Objectives) is an advanced approach that combines natural language descriptions with visual object detection.

### Overview ###
Grounding DINO addresses the challenge of open vocabulary object detection, where a model needs to detect objects that may not have been encountered during training. It leverages the power of natural language descriptions to generalize to unseen object classes and accurately localize objects in images without relying on predefined categories.

### Key Features ###

**Language-Visual Grounding:** Grounding DINO establishes a correspondence between textual descriptions and visual representations. This enables the model to understand and localize objects in images based on textual descriptions alone.

**Flexibility and Adaptability:** By using natural language descriptions, Grounding DINO provides a flexible and adaptable approach. It allows the model to detect a wide range of objects without being limited to a fixed set of predefined categories.

**Open Vocabulary Object Detection:** Grounding DINO serves as a baseline for open vocabulary object detection. It enables the model to detect objects that may not have been encountered during training, making it suitable for scenarios where object classes vary or evolve over time.
